		"text": "I lost my aim to find another reason\nA long way to come\nIt was hard to find way back\nHave courage be kind\nI wish that I did\nNo praying to be blessed\nOnly I can save myself\nThat's the courage to step forward\nThe way you are\nI wish it rescues all\nNever hide away\nEven if that lie to you but that's alright\nIt is never betray\nDepends on how hard try yourselves\nWhy can't you see the ways repeat the same\nCeaseless streams of search to find\nAnd that's the way of touch the way we are\nYou don't have to try to be a shining sun\nThe most beautiful thing is the moon\nReflecting the light\nSomeone said be strong you\nMust be something\nBe sharp to high falsehood with nothing\nThat's not belief\nYou had inside already you have\nI wish we rescue all\nNever hide away\nEven if that lie to you\nBut that's alright\nIt is never betray\nDepends on how hard try yourselves\nWhy can't you see the ways repeat the same\nCeaseless streams of search to find\nAnd that's the way of touch the way we are"
