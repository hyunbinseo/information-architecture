Me and my girlies
We gon party til its early
Got me feeling otherworldly tonight
Caught in some traffic
But the radio is blasting
Drop a red light and we'll sing it goodbye
Ooh
By the morning, feel like magic
I got all I need you know nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancing with my girls
Perfect energy yeah we flawless yeah we free
There's no better feeling in the whole wide world
Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowing up my line
I'd care at 11:59
But nothing counts after midnight
Come and take a ride with me
I got a credit card and some good company
Some come through
Make the fit real good
Why you still stuck on loading
Waiting on you babe
Ooh
Night to morning, live slow motion
I got all I need you know nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancing with my girls
Perfect energy yeah we flawless yeah we free
There's no better feeling in the whole wide world
Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowing up my line
I'd care at 11:59
But nothing counts after midnight
Ooh
By the morning, feel like magic
I got all I need you know nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancing with my girls
Perfect energy yeah we flawless yeah we free
There's no better feeling in the whole wide world
Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowing up my line
I'd care at 11:59
Don't start blowing up my line
